Project Title:
Feedback & Login Support Chatbot

Description:
The Feedback & Login Support Chatbot is a lightweight, Python-based conversational program designed to assist users with two primary functions â€” collecting feedback and providing login-related help. It operates through a simple text-based interface, making it easy to run in any Python-supported environment without additional dependencies.

When launched, the chatbot greets the user and offers two support areas: Feedback and Login Support. In Feedback mode, the bot prompts the user to share their comments, suggestions, or complaints, storing or acknowledging them for future improvements. In Login Support mode, the bot provides a clear menu with three common options:

1. Resetting a forgotten password


2. Changing account details


3. Creating a new account



By selecting an option, the user receives step-by-step guidance. The chatbot also gracefully handles unrecognized input by directing the user back to its supported features.
